# MAGIC %md
# MAGIC You can view the experiment by selecting the beaker icon on the right side of the screen, or choosing "Experiments" from the left menu and selecting your experiment that matches the name of this notebook. Try clicking around to see where the model information resides, how to make charts of the information logged, and where the artifacts such as the feature importance chart can be accessed. Looking at the metrics that were logged it seems like the low proportion of defects may have thrown off our model. Let's upsample our training data before training the next one. Be careful to avoid data leakage when doing this!
