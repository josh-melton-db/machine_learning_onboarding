# Machine Learning on Databricks Onboarding

These notebooks are intended to allow users with experience in typical Python ML libraries (Pandas, SKlearn, etc) to apply their existing skillset to Databricks in an effective way. You will use the functions provided in the utils folder to generate a realistic IOT dataset and begin with data exploration and featurization in the first notebook. The second notebook will walk you through model experimentation and tracking with MLflow as you compare a few iterations of model training and add the best one to the model registry. You'll use that model to make both batch and streaming predictions in notebook three. Finally, the fourth notebook highlights a few more advanced topics such as using pandas in parallel, hyperparameter tuning, custom MLflow models, and nested MLflow model runs. In a bonus fifth notebook you will run deep learning model training in parallel, with each iteration tracked in MLflow.
